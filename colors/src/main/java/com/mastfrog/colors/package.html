        <h1>Gradients and Color Transforms API</h1>
        <p>
            This library serves two functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Performing complex transforms on colors, so a small palette of
                colors can be used to derive a complete UI toolkit's worth of colors
                that are guaranteed to contrast enough to work and be aesthetically
                acceptable</li>
            <li>Providing high-performance implementations of radial and linear
                gradient painting and caching for non-linear gradient painting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Gradients</h2>
        <p>
            The JDK's <code>GradientPaint</code> and 
            <code>LinearGradientPaint</code> both allocate huge rasters in order
            to do their work, frequently resulting in merely painting generating
            a huge amount of garbage and performing badly.  For linear gradient
            paints, you are either painting a gradient along the X axis or Y
            axis, and you can allocate an image that is even one pixel on the
            non-gradient axis and blit that to reproduce the gradient identically,
            no matter the requested X and Y coordinates or non-gradient-axis
            size.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Radial gradients are a similar case - what you actually need is
            an image of 1/4 of the gradient painted rotated and translated
            four times.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are no such optimizations readily available for non-linear
            gradients, most uses of them paint similarly sized gradients (say,
            buttons in a Swing look and feel), and can benefit from caching
            a few instances (using a small LRU cache).
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="GradientPainter.html"><code>GradientPainter</code></a> 
            can be obtained from the <a href="Gradients.html"><code>Gradients</code></a>
            factory class, and handle painting of linear gradients as described.
        </p>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>
            One of the problems in creating custom Swing or other UI components
            is the number of colors you need to map - desiging something with
            customizations for all possible look and feel and theme implementations
            is an impossibility.  A better approach is to take the colors that
            are related to the component you are building (at worst, the UIManager <code>control</code>
            and <code>controlText</code> keys) and whatever other focus colors you
            need, and <i>derive</i> colors that will contrast and fit with the
            theme, no matter what it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="Colors.html"><code>Colors</code></a> and 
            ColorSupplier class allow you to do this, using a subtype of a
            simple <code>Supplier&lt;Color&gt;</code> which has default
            methods that allow you to combine colors, adjust hue, saturation
            and brightness, find the midpoint between colors, or take one
            color and transform it using the hue, saturation or brightness of
            another, and more.
